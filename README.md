# brst-machinelearning

This is a **breast cancer classification app** I made as a first machine learning project. It gave me a better understanding of Pandas and how to import, transform, normalize and use large datasets. 
Other than that, I learned the basics of many machine learning algorithms and how to use libraries incorporating them in Python. 
I am aware that the application could be improved and I am aiming to do this as a side project one day. 

The frontend is done using Streamlit, where I also deployed the application. 

The deployed app can be found here: https://share.streamlit.io/msx-dev/brst-machinelearning/main/Brst.py 

Feel free to roam around the application and if you want to test it, you can use a random value from the dataset, which is found here: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data
